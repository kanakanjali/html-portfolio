<h1>About Me</h1>

<p1>Hi, I’m Kanaknajali Roy, a first-year undergraduate with a strong interest in full-stack web development.</p1>
<br />
<br />
 <p2>I’m currently focused on mastering frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React.
 <br />I’m also exploring backend tools including Node.js and databases like MongoDB.</p2>
<br />

<p3>I enjoy building responsive web applications and experimenting with clean, scalable code.
  <br /> My goal is to continuously improve through hands-on projects, open-source contributions, and by staying updated with the latest in tech.</p3>
<br />
<p4>This website is where I share my projects, progress, and everything I'm learning along the way.</p4>
